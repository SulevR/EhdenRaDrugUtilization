\arguments{
\item{connectionDetails}{An object of type \code{connectionDetails} as created using the
\code{\link[DatabaseConnector]{createConnectionDetails}} function in
the DatabaseConnector package.}

\item{cdmDatabaseSchema}{Schema name where your patient-level data in OMOP CDM format resides.
Note that for SQL Server, this should include both the database and
schema name, for example 'cdm_data.dbo'.}

\item{cohortDatabaseSchema}{Schema name where intermediate data can be stored. You will need to
have write priviliges in this schema. Note that for SQL Server, this
should include both the database and schema name, for example
'cdm_data.dbo'.}

\item{cohortTable}{The name of the table that will be created in the work database
schema. This table will hold the exposure and outcome cohorts used in
this study.}

\item{oracleTempSchema}{Should be used in Oracle to specify a schema where the user has write
priviliges for storing temporary tables.}

\item{outputFolder}{Name of local folder to place results; make sure to use forward
slashes (/). Do not use a folder on a network drive since this greatly
impacts performance.}

\item{databaseId}{A short string for identifying the database (e.g. 'Synpuf').}

\item{databaseName}{The full name of the database (e.g. 'Medicare Claims Synthetic Public
Use Files (SynPUFs)').}

\item{databaseDescription}{A short description (several sentences) of the database.}

\item{createCohorts}{Create the cohortTable table with the exposure and outcome cohorts?}

\item{runDiagnostics}{Run and export the study diagnostics?}

\item{minCellCount}{The minimum number of subjects contributing to a count before it can
be included in packaged results.}

Execute the Study
}
\details{
This function executes the SkeletonComparativeEffectStudy Study. The \code{createCohorts},
\code{synthesizePositiveControls}, \code{runAnalyses}, and \code{runDiagnostics} arguments are
intended to be used to run parts of the full study at a time, but none of the parts are considered
to be optional.
